        <h3>Curiosity for coding</h3>
        <p>
          I am a highly motivated individual who wakes up each day with a
          passion for exploring new ideas and possibilities.<br />
          I have a passion for coding and creating projects that solve
          real-world problems. As a full-stack developer with a focus on Java, I
          enjoy building applications that are both functional and
          user-friendly. I have experience working with a variety of frameworks
          and libraries, including Spring Boot, Hibernate, and React.<br /><br />
          In addition to working on projects for clients, I enjoy exploring
          different ideas for software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. From
          online marketplaces to productivity tools, I'm always on the lookout
          for new opportunities to innovate and create value for users.<br />

        <h3>Curiosity for reading books</h3>
        <p>
          I'm an avid reader, and over the years I've come across several books
          that have had a profound impact on my life.<br />
          These books cover a range of topics, from personal development to
          relationships to spirituality.

        <h3>Favorite activities</h3>
        <p>
          I lead a healthy and balanced lifestyle, with a focus on both physical
          fitness and spiritual well-being. I enjoy a range of physical
          activities, including swimming and exercising in the gym<br />
          In addition to my physical activities, I prioritize my spiritual
          practice, which includes daily meditation. Meditation is a practice
          that has been shown to have numerous benefits for mental health and
          well-being, <br />
          including reducing stress and anxiety and increasing focus and clarity
          of mind. I find that taking the time to quiet my mind and connect with
          my inner self is essential for maintaining balance and perspective in
          my life.
